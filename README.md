# Cognitive Friction Learning System (CFLS)

CFLS is a learning platform that intentionally introduces confusion before instruction to improve conceptual understanding, reduce passive content consumption, and counter doomscrolling behavior.

The system replaces infinite scrolling with cognitive effort by making reasoning the currency for progress.

---

## Core Idea

Traditional learning avoids confusion and encourages passive clarity. CFLS does the opposite.

By introducing misconception-first questions and cognitive conflict, the system:
- Forces active reasoning
- Triggers curiosity
- Improves long-term retention
- Prevents mindless over-consumption

## Key Features

### 1. Confusion-First Learning
Students are first presented with plausible but incorrect scenarios that challenge their assumptions before the correct concept is revealed.

### 2. Focus Score
A dynamic metric that measures reasoning depth instead of speed or time spent. It evaluates:
- Thinking time before answering
- Answer revisions after reflection
- Engagement with hints
- Correction of misconceptions

Wrong answers followed by deep reasoning score higher than lucky guesses.

### 3. Anti-Doomscroll Design
- No infinite scroll
- One concept per screen
- Cognitive locks prevent skipping without reasoning
- Progress requires mental effort, not swipes

### 4. Comparison Dashboard
Visualizes:
- Scroll time saved
- Concepts deeply mastered
- Focus Score trends

This converts saved attention into measurable learning outcomes.

## Target Users
- Students struggling with concentration
- Learners affected by doomscrolling
- Education systems seeking deeper understanding over memorization

## Status
This repository documents the system design and learning logic for hackathon submission. MVP implementation is planned.
